# photo-gallery

First Angular app - test project: photo gallery

Have made this by following a guide at: https://ionicframework.com/docs/angular/your-first-app

It's an interesting way to be introduced to Angular but quite overwhelming!

The finalisation where I have to set permissions and so on for using the camera on Android and MacOS, I will do this later when I know more about Angular.
